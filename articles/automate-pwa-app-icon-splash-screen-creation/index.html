When this happens, instead of displaying a white screen that may signal that the application has stalled, the browser will typically show a splash screen until the main screen becomes available to the user. In order to do this, the required information is taken from <code>manifest.json</code> and <code>index.html</code> files that must contain a declaration of all icons, images, and of course, of the splash screen itself.</p> <p>However, to create a <a href=https://softwareplanetgroup.co.uk/native-vs-html5-vs-react-natve-apps-who-wins-updated/ >native-like experience</a>, you will also have to meet the criteria of your intended PWA platforms and stores: this includes all splash screens, icon sizes and assets.</p> <h2 id=materials>Materials</h2> <p>According to a number of different sources, in order to cover all sizes and platforms, you’ll need approximately 100 images.

Chrome (mostly for Chromebook and ChromeOS) will also select the icon that is the best match for the device’s resolution. While providing 192px and 512px icons will be sufficient in the vast majority of cases, you can provide additional icons to achieve pixel perfection.</p> <p>For iOS, things are more or less straightforward, as we can get all of their screen sizes from the <a href=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/#device-screen-sizes-and-orientations>official design guide</a>. </p> <p>In Android’s case, unfortunately, there are currently no official guidelines, as there are many more smartphones to deal with, with equally varying resolutions and sizes.
